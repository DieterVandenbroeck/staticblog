				<p>Cyber security is a hot topic these days. And that's a good thing, because the people that hold influential positions (think about management in each organization, and governments and regulators) start to realize the importance of the topic as well. </p><p>All this attention also leads to undesirable side effects, such as vendors utilizing an element of fear in their communication to sell products. Where convincing people about the importance might have been difficult before, the scales tip in the wrong direction on other occasions. Spreading fear is a proven tactic to sell (security) services and products, but brings the wrong message.</p><p>A recent report titled "<a href="https://pages.bitglass.com/rs/418-ZAL-815/images/Bitglass_Kings_of_the_Monster_Breaches.pdf">Kings of the Monster Breaches</a>" by Bitglass certainly weighs in. Based on a number of high-profile breaches (including the 2016 Yahoo! breach, the 2017 Equifax breach and the 2018 Marriott and Facebook breaches), a number of key findings are distilled:</p><blockquote>To date, these breaches have cost their companies an average of $347 million in legal fees, penalties, remediation costs, and other expenses. <br>...<br>On average, these enterprises suffered a 7.5% decrease in stock price after being breached, leading to a mean market cap loss of $5.4 billion per company.</blockquote><p>And don't forget that most of these numbers don't include anything on GDPR fines. The ICO recently announced its <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/statement-ico-announces-intention-to-fine-british-airways/">intention to fine British Airways £183.39 million</a> and its <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/07/statement-intention-to-fine-marriott-international-inc-more-than-99-million-under-gdpr-for-data-breach/">intention to fine Marriott £99 million</a> (Bitglass states $912 million in the report, probably the maximum fine).</p><p>To add to the FUD, HyTrust used a poll to check how many customers would change their mind about a breached organization. The result of this was a load of articles claiming that <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/half-of-consumers-business/">half of customers will leave post-breach</a>.</p><blockquote>New research shows that companies are paying a steep price when customers’ information is compromised: more than half of all respondents, 51%, will take their business elsewhere after a breach.</blockquote><p>The average reader probably concludes that a data breach means the end of business operations (who can spend $347 million as a result), their customers (at least half gone) and shareholder trust (how can you recover from a 7.5% decrease in stock price)?</p><p>I believe a more nuanced view is in order. For a few well-known cases I'll try to give a fact-based and nuanced view on the actual impact of the attacks. A short <a href="index.html#companies-that-recently-experienced-a-cyber-attack">overview of companies</a> used as example in this post is included first. In the next sections, I highlight both the <a href="index.html#the-actual-financial-impact">financial impact</a> and impact on <a href="index.html#the-actual-non-financial-impact-investor-trust">investor trust</a> and <a href="index.html#the-actual-non-financial-impact-customer-trust">customer trust</a> experienced by those companies. To skip the details, you can also immediately <a href="index.html#in-conclusion-impacts-are-highly-exaggerated">jump to the conclusion</a>.</p><h2 id="companies-that-recently-experienced-a-cyber-attack">Companies that (recently) experienced a cyber attack</h2><p>For this analysis, I selected 6 different companies that experienced a cyber attack in the last years (between 2013 and 2019) for which sufficient information is available. This means that the company is well-known and the attack serious enough, to ensure sufficient media coverage and publication of relevant information from their side. </p><p>What happened exactly at <strong><u>Norsk Hydro </u></strong>is <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/how-lockergoga-took-down-hydro-ransomware-used-in-targeted-attacks-aimed-at-big-business-c666551f5880">pretty well documented</a>; on 19 March 2019 the LockerGoga ransomware entered the network and disabled the majority of the IT infrastructure. As a result, this global manufacturer with 160 manufacturing locations had to revert back to manual operations.</p><p>What puts Norsk Hydro in a league of its own is the openness with which they handled the incident; they immediately put up a temporary website for communication, used open and honest communication to staff and press, and held a daily webcast with senior staff (taking questions from viewers). </p><p>In full ransomware season, the story of <strong><u>Maersk</u></strong> impacted by NotPetya was told as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">novel story</a>. A good way for people less acquainted to grasp the full impact, and an interesting read for all. In the end, Maersk came out on top, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/25/after_notpetya_maersk_replaced_everything/">praising its IT department and their heroes</a>.</p><p>On 27 June 2017, the Danish business conglomerate best known for being the largest container ship and supply vessel operator, was hit with the NotPetya ransomware. For 10 days, they had to rely on manual procedures impacting not only their own staff, but companies relying on their services worldwide. </p><p>In 2017, the courier / delivery services company <strong><u>FedEx </u></strong>was hit by WannaCry. Later that same year, its Dutch subsidiary TNT Express (still being incorporated in the FedEx IT landscape at the time) was hit by NotPetya. </p><p>The week before Christmas 2013, the American retailer <strong><u>Target</u></strong> had to announce the largest breach ever to happen at the time. At least 41 million customer payment card accounts were impacted and contact information of 70 million customers was compromised.</p><p>Different settlements (class-action lawsuit, MasterCard, Visa, banks and credit unions) took place in 2015, and the largest ever multi-state settlement for a data breach took place in 2017. The first to break the news about the breach was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/sources-target-investigating-data-breach/">Brian Krebs on 18 December 2013</a>, not Target itself. Later on, Target had to retract previously provided information and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-target-databreach/exclusive-target-hackers-stole-encrypted-bank-pins-source-idUSBRE9BN0L220131225">informed customers that PIN data was not stolen after all</a> (encrypted PIN data was part of the breach).</p><p>A year after Target made its announcement, the American home improvement supplies retailer <strong><u>Home Depot</u></strong> had a similar announcement to make. At least 56 million customers' credit and debit card information were stolen, together with 53 million email addresses. This, as well, was the largest data breach at the time, setting a new record.</p><p>Another similarity between the Target and Home Depot data breach was the initial communication: on 2 September 2014 <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/banks-credit-card-breach-at-home-depot/">Brian Krebs shared the news that banks were investigating a credit and debit card breach at Home Depot</a>. An official announcement followed a week after, and Home Depot provided clear information on the investigation and security enhancements it was taking in the days after. </p><p>Even today, the 2017 <strong><u>Equifax</u></strong> data breach is still a hot topic. One of the reasons is probably the report published in March 2019 by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, titled <a href="https://www.carper.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/5/0/508a6447-853f-4f41-85e8-1927641557f3/D5CFA4A0FC19997FF41FB3A5CE9EB6F7.equifax-report-3.6.19.pdf">"How Equifax Neglected Cybersecurity and Suffered a Devastating Data Breach"</a>. This report, tearing down Equifax and its security posture, follows the December 2018 report by the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that details "<a href="https://republicans-oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Equifax-Report.pdf">The Equifax Data Breach</a>". </p><p>It is clear that over the years, government attention to data breaches has grown and companies are being held accountable more and more for their (lack of) actions. On 7 September 2017, Equifax announced it had experienced a data breach earlier in the year. Anticipating customer questions but not the sheer amount of them, their temporary website could not handle the load, the increased call center capacity proved to be inadequate, and their own Twitter account referred to a phishing website.</p><h3 id="the-actual-financial-impact">The actual financial impact</h3><p>Let's put the number of <em>$347 million in legal fees, penalties, remediation costs, and other expenses </em>to the test. To put the financial costs into perspective, they are compared to the annual revenue and profit of the year the incident occurred.</p><p>For <u><strong>Norsk Hydro</strong></u>, a full view on the financial impact is not yet available. The financial report of 2019 will provide more details, but intermediate information was already released. The firm <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norsk-hydro-results/norsk-hydro-core-profit-better-than-expected-despite-cyber-attack-idUSKCN1T60GC">indicated </a>a cost between 300 - 350 million NOK (around $35 - 40 million) in the first quarter, and an additional 200 - 250 million NOK (around $23 - 29 million) in the second quarter. As a guesstimate, a total of up to 950 million NOK (around $110 million) can be set. </p><p>Looking at <a href="https://www.hydro.com/en-BE/about-hydro/facts/">Norsk Hydro's revenue of 2018</a> (159 337 million NOK), the potential cost is limited (0.6% of 2018 revenue). This number does not take into account that certain costs may be recoverable; Norsk Hydro already stated it has a "<a href="https://www.hydro.com/en/media/news/2019/update-on-cyber-attack-march-26/">solid cyber risk insurance policy with recognized insurers</a>". Comparing the cost to their profit (4,323 million NOK) indicates an impact of 22% on the 2018 profit.</p><p>In the <a href="http://investor.maersk.com/static-files/5d68faa5-f869-4c08-8a1d-9660fe889360">2017 <strong><u>Maersk</u></strong></a> <a href="http://investor.maersk.com/static-files/5d68faa5-f869-4c08-8a1d-9660fe889360">annual report</a>, we read that "the effect [of the cyber-attack] on profitability was $250-300 million". With a total profit of $356 million in 2017 (and $711 million in 2016), the attack's impact is up to 84% of the actual profit. Looking at the revenue of 2017 ($30 945 million), the attack accounts to 1% of revenue.</p><p>The annual report also states that "a cyber insurance has been purchased to mitigate some of the potentially negative financial impact of repeated successful cyberattacks in the future". This indicates that no insurance policy was in place at the time of the attack, leaving the full cost at Maersk.</p><p><u><strong>FedEx</strong></u><strong> </strong>had more difficulty estimating the cost associated with the ransomware infection at TNT Express. In its <a href="http://s1.q4cdn.com/714383399/files/oar/2017/AnnualReport2017/AnnualReport2017flat/docs/FedEx_2017_Annual_Report.pdf">2017 annual report</a> we read "given the recent timing and magnitude of the attack, [..] we are still evaluating the financial impact of the attack, but it is likely that it will be material". Something to keep in mind as well is that "we do not have cyber or other insurance in place that covers this attack". </p><p>In the <a href="http://s1.q4cdn.com/714383399/files/oar/2018/AnnualReport2018/assets/pdf/FedEx-Annual-Report-2018.pdf">2018 annual report</a> we can find more clarity; here, FedEx states that "our results for 2018 were negatively impacted by the NotPetya cyberattack by an estimated $400 million during the first half of the year, primarily from loss of revenue [..], as well as incremental costs to restore information-technology systems". If we put this against the $65.5 billion of reported revenue and $4.6 billion of profit, the attack's impact is up to 0,5% of the revenue or 8.7% of profit.</p><p>Understanding the impact of the data breach on <strong><u>Target</u></strong>'s financials requires analysis of the <a href="https://corporate.target.com/_media/TargetCorp/annualreports/2015/pdfs/Target-2015-Annual-Report.pdf">2015 annual report</a> (the breach was announced late 2013, and the report includes a view on "data breach-related costs, net of insurance" for 3 years). Looking at the 'net of tax' numbers, we see costs of $11 million, $94 million and $28 million between 2013 - 2015. This total cost of $133 million after insurance recuperation gives a better number than the $292 million if the cyber insurance would not have pitched in.</p><p>Putting these numbers in perspective, the profit end of 2013 was $1 971 million, putting the accumulated cost of the breach at 14.81% (without insurance) or 6.7% (with insurance) of profit. Compared to their 2013 revenue ($72 596 million), these numbers decrease to 0.4% (without insurance) and 0.2% (with insurance).</p><p><strong><u>Home Depot</u></strong> reported a spending related to the data breach across multiple years. In the <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/reports-and-presentations/annual-reports/annual-report-2014.pdf">annual report of 2014</a>, we read that $63 million of expenses related to the breach have been included, coming down to $33 million of pretax net expenses after recovery under their insurance policy. In the <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/reports-and-presentations/annual-reports/hd-fy-2015-annual-report.pdf">2015</a> and <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/~/media/Files/H/HomeDepot-IR/reports-and-presentations/annual-reports/annual-report-2016.pdf">2016</a> annual reports we read expenses of $198 million ($128 million after insurance) and $37 million (without insurance recuperation). </p><p>In total, this comes down to $298 million without insurance policy, or $198 million in net expenses. This difference is due to their $100 million of network security and privacy liability insurance coverage (above a $10 million deductible). Comparing the total cost of the breach with the net sales ($83 billion) and net profit ($6.3 billion) of 2014, this puts the accumulated cost of the breach at 0.36% (0.24% after insurance) of revenue or 4.7% (3.1% after insurance) of profit.</p><p>The <strong><u>Equifax</u></strong> annual reports of <a href="https://investor.equifax.com/~/media/Files/E/Equifax-IR/Annual%20Reports/2017-annual-report.pdf">2017</a> and <a href="https://investor.equifax.com/~/media/Files/E/Equifax-IR/Annual%20Reports/2018-annual-report.pdf">2018</a> include less information on the actual cost of the breach. Where the other companies included a clear listing of all expenses, the Equifax numbers seem to be spread out. In an <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/equifaxs-data-breach-costs-hit-14-billion-a-12473">analysis</a> of their Q1 2019 financial results, a total cost of $1.4 billion is observed ($82.8 million in technology and data security costs, $12.5 million in quarterly legal and investigative fees, $1.5 million for product liability and $690 million for losses associated with certain legal proceedings and investigations). It is unclear if this number is before or after their $125 million insurance coverage kicked in, although they received the maximum reimbursement under the insurance policy.</p><p>Putting these numbers next to their revenue and profit of 2017, the breach was worth 41.6% of their revenue or 238.5% of their profit.</p><p>Putting it <u><strong>all together</strong></u>, we can conclude that the average of $347 million as costs related to a cyber attack is realistic for very large companies. But this number can be lower (around $100 - $150 million) if a cyber insurance policy is in place. When putting these numbers in the context of the actual organization, we see that ransomware has a higher impact (due to costly system replacements), and that all companies should be able to easily recover (total cost spread over multiple years is lower than yearly profit); Equifax may experience a bit more trouble.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="the-actual-non-financial-impact-investor-trust">The actual non-financial impact: investor trust</h3><p>The number put to the test in this section is the 7.5% decrease in stock price. Although stocks can be traded short-term, a window of 1 year before and 1 year after the breach is included to see if any long-term effect is visible that can be attributed to the cyber attack. </p><p>The stock of <u><strong>Norsk Hydro</strong></u> seems rather unaffected by the LockerGoga issues. In a 2-year window no unexpected decrease can be observed. Looking in more detail at the week of the announcement (Monday 18 March - Friday 22 March 2019), stock price went down from $4.19 to $4.07, a trend observed in the weeks prior to the incident as well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Norsk Hydro stock seems unaffected.</figcaption></figure><p>A loss of customers cannot be calculated as the incident occurred too recently.</p><p>Observing a 2-year view of the <strong><u>Maersk</u></strong> stock, it is possible to conclude that the impact of the NotPetya ransomware is visible. The highest notation is just after a year-long increase until 1 July 2017, after which the stock price decreases again. Putting this against a market trend (the S&amp;P 500 Index), this may be a direct result of the cyber attack. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Maersk stock (MAERSKA and MAERSKB in blue and green) compared to the S&amp;P 500 (yellow).</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the <strong><u>FedEx</u></strong> stock, there is a linear increase in average price over a 2-year view. Even in the monthly fluctuations, it is not possible to accurately indicate when the attack hit them. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>FedEx stock seems unaffected.</figcaption></figure><p>The effect on <strong><u>Target</u></strong> stock is less clear, even though there is a decrease in price over the months after the breach was announced. Because this decrease in stock price was already happening months before the announcement and because the stock was listed a lot higher 1 year after the breach, it is impossible to draw well-motivated conclusions on correlation between both events.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>No well-motivated conclusions can be drawn from Target stock.</figcaption></figure><p>Over a 2-year period, <strong><u>Home Depot</u></strong> may be happy with the data breach. After a calm year where the stock price remained more or less the same, all the publicity on the breach may have boosted the price. The price stagnation seems unrelated to the announcement a few months before and might be due to a difference in year-start and year-end (observed in the prior year as well).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Home Depot stock seems unaffected.</figcaption></figure><p>Off all companies, <strong><u>Equifax</u></strong> is the only one where the stock price drastically went down in response of the breach announcement. Although an increase on the average price can still be observed, the stock was worth a lot less 1 year after the breach than just before. Today, it is almost back at its pre-breach value (almost 2 years after).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/07/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Equifax stock price took a dive after the announcement and recovers with great difficulty.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-actual-non-financial-impact-customer-trust">The actual non-financial impact: customer trust</h3><p>The last test is the claimed loss of 51% of customers. When reading through the annual reports, it's clear organizations of such size are simultaneously executing a lot of different plans to grow. This includes mergers and acquisitions, diversification of products and services towards existing and new customers, and serving a larger area (e.g. expanding to other continents). A decrease of the customer base at the time of the breach may be partly gone months after when other plans are in execution. </p><p>Because the <strong><u>Norsk Hydro</u></strong> incident occurred end of Q1 2019, most of the impact should only show as of the second quarter of 2019. Because this information is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/07/09/1880120/0/en/Norsk-Hydro-Invitation-Hydro-s-second-quarter-results-2019.html">not yet available</a> (publication on 23 July), no conclusion can be drawn here.</p><p>For <strong><u>Maersk</u></strong> we see a happy story; the revenue of 2016 was the lowest in 3 years (from $35 billion in 2014 to $27 billion in 2016), but veered up again in 2017 ($31 billion) and skyrocketed in 2018 ($39 billion).</p><p>Even if other activities account for attracting a different customer base, a huge loss of customers as a result of the incident cannot have happened. </p><p>A good growth is also observed at <strong><u>FedEx</u></strong>; their revenue went up from $50 billion in 2016 to $60 billion in 2017 and $65 billion in 2018. </p><p>The sales at <strong><u>Target</u></strong> did not suffer from a massive loss of customers. Although the sales in 2013 were slightly lower than those in the previous year ($71 279 million in 2013 compared to $71 960 in 2012), the next years showed a growth around $1 000 million to end with $73 785 million in 2015. </p><p>At <u><strong>Home Depot</strong></u>, there was clearly no loss of customers. Both in number of customer transactions as in average ticket sales value, an increase can be observed. In 2013 the number of customer transactions was 1 390 million, with an average sales value of $56.78. This increased linearly to 1 500 million transactions in 2015 for an average of $58.77. Not only did the number of customers grow, each customer spent more money.</p><p>Reading and interpreting the <strong><u>Equifax</u></strong> numbers is more challenging. In the 'U.S. Information Solutions' segment (providing consumer and commercial information solutions to US business), no real growth or decline can be seen. Because this market is dominated by only 3 players, a direct impact from the data breach is unsure. Both the 'International' and 'Workforce Solutions' show significant growth, with a sizable decrease in 'Global Consumer Solutions' segment (from $400 million in 2016-2017 to $372 in 2018). The latter may be because consumer protection services (such as a credit freeze) were offered for free as a result of the data breach. Overall, it cannot be said that many customers departed from the breached company.</p><h2 id="in-conclusion-impacts-are-highly-exaggerated">In conclusion, impacts are highly exaggerated</h2><p>Putting everything together, it is clear that statements about the impact of cyber attacks are highly exaggerated. Of course, the direct financial impact is not to be underestimated; there's a serious cost associated with responding to such an event. A cyber insurance policy could already cover part of the costs (potentially even all costs for organizations smaller than the examples), and some of the required costs may have been due anyway (e.g. upgrading certain systems and controls).</p><p>In terms of investor and customer trust, there are no strong indications that there is any long-term impact. There will always be some impact, some of it very visible and short-term (such as an investor scare resulting in a serious dip in the value of shares), others difficult to quantify and difficult to estimate the actual impact (such as employees experiencing a loss of motivation). How an organization responds to such an event is crucial; owning the communication instead of reacting to media outbursts, honest and open communication, and having attention to the people impacted by the incident (such as the people whose information is breached) could make the difference.</p>
