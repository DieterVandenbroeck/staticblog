			<section class="post-content">
				<p>In 2013, the 'general' public learned that the average car can be hacked rather easily. To be honest, rather easily still means investing a lot of time (and a small amount of money for parts), some really specific knowledge and physical access to the car's internal interface. Given the amount of control the attacker can acquire (full control over all acceleration, steering, breaking, etc.) and the how-to guides that are already available for specific models, the likelihood of actual attacks is not to be underestimated.</p><p>Today, cars are not the only kind of vehicle that can be hacked. Security researcher Chris Roberts was taken and questioned by the FBI after jokingly tweeting that he was on a plane, and that he might hack into the internal communication system. Although the tweet was not meant as a threat but merely a joke (it was a vulnerability he had been mentioning to Boeing and Airbus for many years), some people had a different sense of humor. But hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinion about not properly securing a passenger plane as well.</p><p>Taking control of a passenger plane would be rather dangerous: if you already would be able to take control of the plane, and you would think this is a smart move because you 'really really want to possess a plane', you'd have to be inside the plane taking full control over it on any device you'd have on you. Not a move many would be able to pull off. Stealing a yacht without being on it sounds like a much better idea. To be fair, you'd have to do this while someone is navigating based solely on the information from the GPS system, but Todd Humphreys and his team were able to do just that, misguiding an 80 million USD yacht to a destination of their choice.</p><p>The worst part is, many vehicles rely on GPS signals to navigate. Jokes about getting a free drone for every future Amazon delivery are becoming reality, but the delivery might not even be necessary. The maldrone malware, essentially malware targeted specifically at drones, can be delivered by another drone flying in proximity of the target drone. Even though military drones use encrypted GPS signals, reverse engineering a captured drone resulted in the release of a manual indicating how to take control of the military vehicle. Let's hope the US performs some visual checks before bombing a city.</p><p>Something that is not clear from all of these stories, is that we probably don't even know how far researchers have gotten. Cars, trains, and metros are already offering wireless internet on a regular basis. But it's hard to believe that all manufacturers nicely separated the important traffic from the end-user traffic. Soon, it will (probably) be possible to take control over such a vehicle, without the need for any physical connections.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.techtimes.com/articles/30634/20150204/drone-hacking-next-big-security-concern.htm">https://www.techtimes.com/articles/30634/20150204/drone-hacking-next-big-security-concern.htm</a> </p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wondering-how-hack-military-drone-its-all-google-1500326">https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wondering-how-hack-military-drone-its-all-google-1500326</a> </p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/6489/gps.pdf">https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/6489/gps.pdf</a> </p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/162462-hackers-hijack-a-super-yacht-with-simple-gps-spoofing-and-planes-could-be-next">https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/162462-hackers-hijack-a-super-yacht-with-simple-gps-spoofing-and-planes-could-be-next</a> </p><p>[5] <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2903714/60-diy-car-hacking-device-is-an-inexpensive-and-easy-way-to-hack-cars.html">https://www.computerworld.com/article/2903714/60-diy-car-hacking-device-is-an-inexpensive-and-easy-way-to-hack-cars.html</a> </p><p>[6] <a href="https://jalopnik.com/how-a-14-year-old-hacked-a-car-with-15-worth-of-radio-1686620075">https://jalopnik.com/how-a-14-year-old-hacked-a-car-with-15-worth-of-radio-1686620075</a> </p><p>[7] <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/05/feds-say-banned-researcher-commandeered-plane/">https://www.wired.com/2015/05/feds-say-banned-researcher-commandeered-plane/</a> </p><p>[8] <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/07/24/hackers-reveal-nasty-new-car-attacks-with-me-behind-the-wheel-video/</a></p>
