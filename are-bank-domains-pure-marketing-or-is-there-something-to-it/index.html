			<section class="post-content">
				<p>Domain names were invented to help humans in reaching locations on the internet. IP addresses are still the primary identification used, but they are pretty hard to remember (and IPv6 does not help with that). Humans prefer easy-to-remember domain names, and search engines made our life even easier. Although not always strictly followed, domain names become more specific from the right to the left whereby the most right part (the top-level domain or TLD) indicates a location (such as .be for Belgium), a purpose (such as .biz for business) or a restricted group / organisation (such as .mil for military and .edu for institutes of higher education).</p><p>When this system was originally launched in 1998, the set of available TLDs was limited. During the years after its launch many TLDs have been added to enable domain names that speak for themselves. One of these more recently added TLDs is the .bank domain. In 2011 a coalition of banks, insurance companies and financial services trade associations from around the world formed a new organization: fTLD Registry Services. One of the first actions of this new organisation was to submit an application for the .bank and .insurance TLDs in 2012. ICANN -the organisation that oversees domain names- granted the right to operate the .bank after an evaluation of 2 years (more specifically on September 14, 2015). A few months later, ICANN included .bank in their list of valid top-level domains.</p><p>Using a .bank domain name has an obvious marketing advantage: often banks are located in multiple countries and have ‘bank’ somewhere in their name. This often leads to domain names including ‘bank’ and a choice between multiple country-specific domains or a single .com domain. A single .bank domain helps establishing a strong banking brand that is reflected online as well.</p><p>Another advantage of such a domain name is increased security. In a worst-case scenario, an entire bank’s online presence could be hijacked. Of course this is exceptional, but in October 2016 a Brazilian bank suffered that fate. This attack was executed by very skilled attackers and resulted in complete control over the bank’s domain for 6 hours. During this time, the attackers controlled all traffic between customers and the bank, regardless of the interface: mobile app, online banking website, intra-banking exchanges, even the ATMs connected back to the attackers. The exact impact for the bank is unknown, but they will suffer the consequences for years to come.</p><p>Would a .bank domain name have prevented such an attack from occurring? It is believed that the attack was possible due to a compromise of the bank’s account at the DNS registrar. A compromise of this account enabled the attackers to rightfully change the endpoint of the domain names. After this change, the attackers had full control. This control was even so powerful that the bank couldn’t send an email, only complicating communication with customers and with external parties (such as the DNS registrar). The security requirements imposed for .bank domain names are likely to have prevented this attack, or at least make it vastly more complicated. Mandatory two-factor authentication to make significant changes to DNS records likely would have made this attack a lot harder, if not impossible to carry out.</p><p>A branding benefit for banks of course is a branding benefit for attackers as well. If a bank has not (yet) registered its .bank domain, this would provide an extremely valuable asset for phishers. Luckily this was envisioned when defining the security requirements. The name selection policy already provides an indication of suitability of a domain for a certain organization. Of course such a policy is useless if it cannot be enforced; when requesting a .bank domain name, a screening procedure is executed by Symantec to ensure the domain is linked to an actual bank. This means that an attacker should never be able to register a .bank domain; the only exception would be if the attackers can pursued multiple specific people within a bank that has not yet registered its own .bank domain.</p><p>All in all, this seems like an interesting opportunity for banks all over the world. In reality however, it seems as if banks are holding back. Using information from Shodan and Censys I was able to identify 260+ unique .bank domains that are actually in use. This number is very likely to be incomplete, but already gives a good indication of the current usage. Verifying manually with some well-known banks confirms this story: the domain may have been registered, but there is no online presence. This means that more than 2 years after the .bank domain names became available, only a small percentage of banks actually use this opportunity.</p><p>It becomes even more interesting when looking at the full list of available TLDs. Many banks have their own TLD, and most of these don’t have an active .bank domain. And yet, with both options available, their main domain is still a ‘regular’ .com domain. Changing all domain names is extremely difficult (imagine exchanging all websites, email addresses and endpoints used by software), but one would presume this was considered when the .bank TLD was first created.</p><p>In conclusion, the idea of a .bank domain that offers clear branding and mandatory security requirements around its usage sounds like a good idea. Over the next few years it will become clear if the world is ready to embrace this idea, or if the already-known domain names remain too important for the banks to make the switch.</p>
