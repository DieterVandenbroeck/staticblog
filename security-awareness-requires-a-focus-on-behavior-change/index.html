				<p>Now that we're more than 7 weeks into 2021, most reports looking back on the previous year are finalized and published. It should be no surprise that COVID-19 and the impact to our daily lives can be found in each and every one of these reports. </p><p>One of the biggest impacts of this worldwide pandemic is the remote working that most of us are limited to. For some people this drastically improves their work-life balance, bringing new options to their lives that were previously not possible. For others, being confined to digital interactions and the same location each and every day is the worst thing to happen. </p><p>For attackers, this shift to remote working brought interesting times as well. Relying only on a digital presence to get into an organization, attackers were already operating this way to compromise their victims. The main difference is that a lot more victims suddenly became available; many organizations were not ready to work remotely, relying on the safety of the offices to guard their internal network and sensitive data. Suddenly making this available online to ensure the daily operations could continue, introduced a high, unmanaged cybersecurity risk for many organizations.</p><p>Working in a more isolated manner, with an already heightened security risk, employees are more than ever a crucial component in the security defense of every organization. A good level of awareness is paramount, so organizations are trying to figure out how to raise this level of awareness in a very short amount of time.</p><p>A mistake often seen with security awareness is working in a 'push' manner without validating if this is effective. An example of this are articles published on the intranet (on new rules, tips &amp; tricks, etc.) that are not read by the organization. Of course, sending an email to everyone provides a higher likelihood of reaching many people, but it makes sense that not every team can send around emails to the entire organization to their liking. If intranet is the only option for broad communication, this option should indeed be used. But if you see that only 1% of employees opens the article, can you say it was a success? If the average reach of such articles is around 1%, is it worth continuing the same way? Complaining that this is the only option you have is not going to change the situation, but keeping doing the same thing over and over is not going to change it either.</p><p>Another example of common mistakes is the mandatory security awareness e-learning. Often a quiz at the end, where you have to achieve a minimum score, is seen as an effective way to ensure employees have gained some knowledge. Let's be honest, this is still just a compliance-checkbox exercise and hardly ever yields good results. People know how to get through mandatory learnings as fast as possible, and people know how to get a passing mark without any effort. They may even know the correct answer when it comes to recognizing phishing email examples or the correct filesharing solution to use within the organization. The main question to ask is what they will do 5 minutes later when they're back to work: will they showcase they learned something, or will they continue doing what they've always done, secure or insecure, regardless of what the training said? </p><p>The key to successful security awareness is a focus on behavior change. Don't just rely on pushing out messages and hoping people will do as ordered. Clearly define what the current behavior is and what the reasons are; often, insecure behaviors today may exist because the secure alternative is just too difficult or cumbersome to use. If you know what the starting position is, you can better steer towards your secure, target situation. </p><p>Don't expect people to just change their behavior after seeing a post on intranet about the secure alternative. Maybe your reach indicators already show you that only 1% of the organizations will read this. Of that very small population that you actually reach, not many will change their behavior just like that. Is there a benefit for them (e.g. easier to use for them or cheaper for their department resulting in a higher budget for the offsite) or is there strict enforcement (e.g. having to go and explain to top management when not following the rules, or resulting in a lower budget for the offsite)? Or do you rely on ambassadors throughout the different teams that bring the message to people everywhere, helping with the typical arguments against the secure alternative and the standard how-to's? </p><p>Never forget, people do not like change. Security awareness is all about changing people's behavior, which they typically will not like. Make sure to be realistic in what can be achieved, in the effort it requires to bring forward a change in the entire organization, and in how it will be perceived by people. Ambassadors and gamification can help you in this course, but you will have to steer through a sea filled with people adverse to any change.</p><p>Within projects, the importance of change and focusing on achieving the behavior change (and with it, achieving the project objectives) is well understood (after many failures in the past). Draw the same lessons for your security awareness efforts, dare to be critical about your own work and approach, and be realistic in the effort required to achieve success.    </p>
