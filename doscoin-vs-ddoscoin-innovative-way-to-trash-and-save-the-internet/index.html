				<p>Blockchain is the new kid on the block and everyone wants a piece of it. Although most people directly associate blockchain with Bitcoin (the first real use of Blockchain), there is so much more to the technology than cryptocurrencies. Let's keep that idea for another time and keep our focus in the area of cryptocurrencies for the moment.</p><p>Give the internet a new toy and they'll find a way to ruin it. At least, part of the internet will. The other part will create something wonderful that is noble in design. This dual approach can also be seen in DoScoin and DDoSCoin; similar in name but so different in actual working and design ideology.</p><p>Shortly after the massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against KrebsOnSecurity the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/ ">source code for 'mirai' was released</a>. This malware specifically targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are poorly secured by design. Because of the large (and still growing) amount of such devices, they could be used to launch the biggest DDoS attack every seen (at least until that day). Developing and spreading such a successful malware is not a sinecure, and making the source code publicly available ensures it cannot be reliably used by the original attackers anymore.</p><p>The attack itself is believed to have <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/our-thinking/state-of-the-internet-report/ ">peaked at a staggering 623 Gbps</a>. The amount of traffic in this attack needed to be so high because Akamai was protecting the KrebsOnSecurity website. Akamai distributes traffic to many different locations as close to the source as possible and scrubs out all malicious traffic, aiming at keeping websites online by filtering away as much malicious traffic as possible. Of course such a service is not free and many resources and a huge international infrastructure are needed to make this work.</p><p>Comes into play: <strong><strong><a href="https://github.com/Mako500/doscoin-master ">DoScoin</a></strong></strong>. This cryptocurrency cannot be mined using CPU or GPU cycles focussed on solving cryptographic problems (the way most cryptocurrencies can be mined), but awards people who give up some (usually unused) bandwidth that to absorb actual DDoS attacks. When normal people close to the attacking botnet absorb the attacker's traffic, not only the target (like a website) but all infrastructure that would otherwise be suffering from all this traffic can be spared. Generating coins gives you a reward for bandwidth you're unlikely to use, keeps traffic away from the internet infrastructure everyone uses and helps mitigating attacks. Considering most DDoS attacks are launched against legitimate targets due to personal reasons, you could earn money doing a good thing you hardly notice!</p><p>But of course there's the evil twin: <strong><strong><a href="https://github.com/ewust/DDoSCoin">DDoSCoin</a></strong></strong>. This cryptocurrency also rewards the average Joe based on unused bandwidth, but aims at the other side of the story. Why would you try to infect thousands of machines all over the world, writing malware that gives you persistent access and may be targeted by law enforcement, when you can convince people to give up the bandwidth you need in an attack just like that? When people can be rewarded for participating in a DDoS attack without having to do anything and without noticing much of it, there's a huge potential of people actively participating in such attacks. Will they participate in illegal activities? Yes, very likely. Will they ever be prosecuted for it? Probably not... And when DDoSCoins can be traded for other cryptocurrencies who eventually can be traded in for hard cash, the internet found a good way to turn a wonderful technology into another way to screw itself over.</p>
