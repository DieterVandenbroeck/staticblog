				<p>A lot of commercial and free software has security vulnerabilities. A lot of websites publicly available on the internet have security vulnerabilities. Worst of all, this is not even new. CVE was launched back in 1999 and the number of CVE identifiers has known a rapid growth until 2006 (with 6,608 CVE identifiers). Things seem to go a little better now with only 4,150 CVE identifiers in 2011 (although 2012 wasn’t really following that trend), but you can’t really regard this as a turn towards a safer digital world. Why are we not getting the hang of creating safe(r) products?</p><p>It’s definitely not the lack of information available. OWASP was created in 2001 and offers clear information, cheat sheets for developers, tools to really get the hang of it and maintains the ‘OWASP Testing Guide’. The latter is considered by many as <em>the</em> guide for secure development and <em>the</em> reference for website vulnerability assessments. Is it reluctance? Is it ignorance? Or is the business not willing to pay for security?</p><p>There never is just 1 answer, and this question is no different. Yes, sometimes the business doesn't want to pay extra (because they don't understand the risk). Or even worse, some contracts even state that security (usually as an afterthought) will cost extra. However, the root cause of most vulnerabilities is simply ignorance. For a presentation at a Belgium university with the audience consisting of 'mainly bachelor / master students in computer science', we prepared a presentation around attack trends. Afterwards, during a chat with the students and a drink at hand, it became clear that almost nobody from the audience knew what a SQL injection is. Think about it: a lot of these will become responsible in some way for developed products, but have no clue what this attack or its potential impact is.</p><p>This got me thinking about my own time in university. Fun fact: my education started with programming in C. The points on the exam could be lost quickly, as 1) all exercises were on paper and 2) every out-of-bounds removed half of your points. Why this was important at that point: just to maintain the correct program flow and don't have any crashes. (Remote) code execution? No, not even mentioned during this class.</p><p>Further down the road came the more advanced classes involving bigger coding projects, architectures, web applications (make it fancy, make it work, don't care about anything else), and so on. Only during my masters I had the choice to follow some security-related classes. And this is, according to me, a really big problem with today's education. How can you expect someone to write secure code or design a secure product, if he never even heard about the potential risks while learning about creating these products.</p><p>If security remains 'just an afterthought' or 'an expensive blocking gate before the Go/No-Go', the same mistakes will be made and the same hacks will be performed. And be honest now: what (big) company is waiting for its customer data + source code of all major products to be stolen?</p><p>CVE statistics: <a href="https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics-results?cves=on">http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics-results?cves=on</a> </p><p>OWASP: <a href="https://www.owasp.org/">https://www.owasp.org</a></p>
