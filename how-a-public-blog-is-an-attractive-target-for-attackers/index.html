			<section class="post-content">
				<p>Since I <a href="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/posts/migrating-a-blog">migrated my blog</a> earlier this year, I gained more control. This brought more control in its setup and management, but also more control and insight on how people interact with it. When something is publicly available on the internet, it will always be used for good and for evil. Last week I noticed someone was performing an automated vulnerability scan and an analysis of the logs brought some interesting insights I wanted to share.When someone leaves a new comment, it is not automatically publicly visible. To avoid spam, I choose for manual verification over a captcha for two simple reasons: the 'older' captchas, the mangled combination of letters and numbers, are just impossible to get right in less than 3 attempts. The newer challenge, a game or a checkbox, is time consuming to complete and had an <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~polakis/papers/sivakorn_eurosp16.pdf">implementation issue</a> that defeated the purpose of the captcha. I realise that the latter has been fixed and probably not applicable to a personal blog such as mine, but it contributed to my decision.When a comment is posted, it is added in the back-end in an 'unverified' state and an email notification is sent to me. This allows me to review all comments prior to publication and allows me to react in due time to new comments. Of course when someone uses an automated scanner, the result can look something like this (a separate conversation is used for comments related to each post):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Comments_ZAP_fuzzing.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Comments_ZAP_fuzzing.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Last week I received a large number of emails while at work and being away for the evening, making me believe someone was fuzzing my blog during an extended period of time. When checking the back-end during the weekend, I noticed all comments were posted during a 15-minute window:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_sql_1-PNG.png" class="kg-image" alt="Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_sql_1.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>...</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_sql_2-PNG.png" class="kg-image" alt="Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_sql_2.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Due to the type of comments (different payloads aimed at exploiting typical web application vulnerabilities), the large number of comments (1549) and the small timeframe (15 minutes), it was clear this was an automated test (1 comment every 1,7 seconds). Looking at the name in the comments, I quickly learned someone was using ZAProxy. And apparently the lists that were used only contained 100 entries or the person testing my blog's security personally limited the entries on each post to 100.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_start.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Comments_ZAP_fuzzing_start.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Of course, this is not the only insight I have. The web server logs reveal another story; the IP address used to test the security of the comments already connected a large number of times the day before testing the comments functionality. On the first day, after reading the <a href="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/posts/brucon-0x08-ey-challenge-write-up">Brucon 2016 EY challenge write-up</a> and the <a href="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/responsible-disclosure">responsible disclosure</a> section this person started enumerating existing resources (again automated):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/All_traffic_story-PNG.png" class="kg-image" alt="All_traffic_story.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Because this didn't yield any interesting results, I presume the search and comments functionality were the next targets the following day.Personally I welcome people testing the security of my blog as explained in the [responsible-disclosure](responsible disclosure) section. Something that should not be forgotten is that not everyone is as open to the idea as I am. When using your own IP to perform such testing activities (instead of tunneling through a VPN or another solution), the people you target might be interested in taking a look back. When you have an exposed Synology diskstation interface exposed, I really hope you have a solid password:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Origin_exposed_diskstation.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Origin_exposed_diskstation.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the reputation of your IP address (removed from the screenshots) and what your ISP might do when multiple abuse complaints are received. I was just curious to see where the traffic was coming from (country-wise) and was looking at various Chinese and Russian sources before stumbling at this particular test. Even though the information is limited, it gives a good idea on the approximation of the origin, regardless if this person used his own IP address or not (probably a yes). Because there reputation of the origin was 'good' I dug deeper to understand what exactly was tested and if something was discovered. I'm just curious and will mask the information here, but companies or other individuals might retaliate by attacking back or trying to lower your IP reputation / file abuse complaints with your ISP - so be careful.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Origin_stats.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Origin_stats.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/Origin_stats2.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Origin_stats2.PNG" loading="lazy"></figure><p>And a big thanks to Jens for pointing out a few items I missed (you know, exposed admin ages and stuff)</p>
