			<section class="post-content">
				<p>Big news yesterday as the researchers of Duo Labs not only <a href="https://duosecurity.com/blog/duo-security-researchers-uncover-bypass-of-paypal-s-two-factor-authentication">announced</a> they are able to bypass PayPalâ€™s two-factor authentication (2FA) verification, but also published the exact details on how this can be achieved. PayPal immediately pushed a <a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/PayPal-Forward/Working-with-the-Security-Community/ba-p/828224">comment</a>, ensuring users that all accounts, with or without 2FA enabled, remain secure. Additionally, they disabled authentication through mobile applications for accounts that have 2FA enabled. So, the researchers did not want to get paid by PayPal to privately disclose their vulnerability and wanted to put PayPal on the spot to force a quick reaction, right?</p><p>PayPal introduced its bug bounty program almost exactly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130413035405/https://www.thepaypalblog.com/2012/06/paypal-bug-bounty-program/">2 years ago</a>. Today, the reward researchers can receive for their responsible disclosure to PayPal (and adhering to their conditions) <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security-tools/reporting-security-issues">ranges between $750 and $10,000</a>. For this particular vulnerability, a reward (up to $3,000) seems to be applicable. So again, the researchers didnâ€™t want the money and wanted to force PayPal in a corner?</p><p>On March 29, the issue was reported to PayPalâ€™s bug bounty program. It took almost a full month until a first response is received (April 25), indicating the issue is still under investigation. Another month later (May 29), â€˜additional informationâ€™ (screenshots that are not automatically truncated by their own system) and the proof of concept source code is requested. Finally, early June (June 3) they indicate that the submission is eligible for a bounty, indicating they have been able to replicate the issue and fully understand the impact. In that month, the researchers indicate their intent to publicly disclose the vulnerability on June 25, and remain in contact with PayPal to test â€˜patchesâ€™ and communicate about target implementation dates.</p><p>It seems like PayPal was working hard on fixing the issue after all, so was the public disclosure really the responsible thing to do? Yes. The bug bounty program exists for almost 2 years, and claimed to be the first financial services company to do so. That alone is admirable and shows commitment towards securing their environment (and customer details). But if you are unable to work on such an issue for 2 months, the expertise and commitment of the team is to be questioned. If the Duo Labs researchers were able to find this vulnerability, itâ€™s reasonable to assume someone with malicious intends can find and <a href="http://blog.lumension.com/8849/how-to-bypass-paypal-two-factor-authentication/#comment-52706">actively exploit it as well</a>. So again, yes, the responsible thing to do was to publicly disclose the vulnerability and force PayPal to react. Hopefully, the team will require less time to investigate the next submitted vulnerability.</p>

							<p class="post-nav-excerpt">With Apple Pay, it seems that Apple has introduced a new system that is actually capable of making payments using a credit card, without the risk of losing all credit card numbers in a breach. The solution, based on per-device per-card tokenization, could really help end-user AND merchants.&hellip;</p>
