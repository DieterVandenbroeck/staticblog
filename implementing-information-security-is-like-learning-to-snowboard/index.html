			<section class="post-content">
				<p>Measuring maturity is not always an easy task; whereas age can be rather easily defined (an indication of time), maturity is more abstract and links more to ‘an indication of how good you are at something / how well you learned from your mistakes and improved’. The same difficulty can be found in measuring the maturity of information security within an organization. Even if you succeed in having a single measurement of maturity in time, obtaining measurements over time in a repeatable way and with results that can be compared and can be explained and defended to management is hard. Luckily there are some widespread methods that are aimed at solving this problem.</p><p>One of the options to measure the maturity of information security is using the <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/capability-maturity-model-integration">CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)</a> model, in its original format or through another methodology based on the principles. Simply put, the original CMMI model is based on 5 levels that can be used for 1 main purpose: to benchmark yourself against a certain target. This can be against peers or competitors, but can also be used to track progress over time.</p><p>One of the key benefits of this model is that it can be used in many situations and that it allows for simplicity: all the complexity is reduced to numbers. Talking about the current state of an organisation is hard, especially when the conversation is not limited to very specific aspects. Pinpointing why (additional) budget for information security is needed usually requires quantified risks, where decisions are diminished to a comparison of the financial impact and the spending. In case these numbers are not available, a benchmark against peers and specific targets based on simple numbers representing a maturity might make for an easier discussion.</p><p>Using such a model obviously has drawbacks as well; simple targets based just on a (set of) number(s) can draw attention away from what you are trying to achieve. A risk-based approach where spending is tailored to the actual risks of an organisation keeps your eyes on the target but requires a lot of effort to set up and maintain; without this accurate decisions will not be feasible and discussions about the different between two numbers (representing a huge difference) can take up a lot of effort and time.</p><p>Back to the actual levels that are defined by the CMMI model. The first level 'Initial' denotes a state that is unpredictable and reactive. The right actions may be executed, but you don't have any certainty that this will be the case. 'Managed', the second level, is described as having a certain control over the situation, being somewhat prepared. Higher up the scale is 'Defined' whereby an organisation is proactive rather than reactive. Higher up the ladder is 'Quantitatively' to end with 'Optimizing', hinting at a stable and controlled state and, in the end, a stable and flexible state.</p><p>These descriptions give some idea already, but the interesting part is in the highest level. Only there the notion of flexibility is introduced, meaning that all lower levels mean tailoring towards a specific situation that is described, followed, measured, compared, analysed and optimised before it can be made flexible. This reduces the error margin and ensures full control can be exerted over a situation, but sounds rather restricting as well. Can you always properly bring something down to a fully predictable state?</p><p>This winter I went on a snowboard trip. I've skied a few times before but always envied snowboarders, whose style going downhill could best be described as majestic. Because I never tried snowboarding before and because I'm rather unstable on skateboards and the like I decided to take a short lesson and try out a bit before being in the mountains. During only a few hours I went from an absolute noob (my feet go where?) to me going down a nice slope comfortably. I felt extremely good about myself and fully prepared for the mountains. Up into the mountains a few weeks after it seemed as if I had lost almost all skills I had acquired before. It took me a long time to get as comfortable on the mountain as I had been on the practice slope. Where was the difference? And if I had built up so much in the initial few hours but needed a few days to regain that level and increase only a little bit after that, how long would it take me to get really good?</p><p>On the mountain I had different gear that was a slightly worse fit than during the first time (boots that didn’t fit as well), the snow was different and I was tired after a night of driving without sleep. The skills I thought I had built up before apparently were only applicable for the initial conditions. And it took me the full 3 days to get close and slightly above those initially obtained skills in very different and changing conditions (going from very sunny to a snow storm that forced half of the mountain to close down). So how long would it take me next time to be comfortable again? And how long would it take me to improve?</p><p>The same can be said about the CMMI model and about implementing information security. Initially you can (drastically) increase the maturity with limited effort. But all changes you make - all new processes and activities, all tools and dashboards - need to be maintained. To improve even more you need to spend effort on maintaining your initial gain and spent effort on improvements. On top of that, at first you will have quick wins available that can have a big impact. Once these are achieved, you will need a clear vision to work through, often with many obstacles. The first steps are easy and you can make a lot of progress quickly with little effort; maintaining the achieved level takes effort and increasing further gets harder and harder.</p><p>So yes, the more mature you are in terms of information security, the more effort you have to spend to improve. And the speed at which you achieve improvements cannot serve as predictions (or guidance) for future improvements. But if you really want to go for your goal, achieving it will give you a good feeling, regardless of the obstacles.</p>
