				<p>In the last few weeks I've migrated this blog away from its original platform (Blogger). When I initially started this blog in 2013, Blogger was a great option: I could get started immediately without having to invest a lot of time to get things up and running. But as always, this comes at a cost. Lately the downsides were becoming too much of an obstacle for me, and I took the decision to go and find a better alternative.</p><p>The obstacles that pushed me away from Blogger were mostly the lack of flexibility. Things like structured text, a clean and lightweight outlook and a custom domain name were becoming increasingly important for me. In Blogger you can edit the template of your blog, including the structured text. But this is an incredible mess to sort through, and even with 20% of 'fat' reduced without any visible impact (mostly support for options I didn't use), the amount of transferred data was still huge compared to what was actually needed. A very silly and incredibly stupid issue (from Blogger's side) was the fact that the structured data could not pass validation by default, indicating a lack of actually caring about their users. but what pushed me to this decision in the end was the lack of support for HTTPS when using your own domain name.</p><p>When looking for an alternative a few things were important to me: I didn't want to spent too much time, effort or money on keeping this thing up and running. I wanted something that was flexible yet easy to use. It soon became clear this was not an easy target. I looked at a few SAAS solutions (Ghost looked very promising) but couldn't find a solution that mastered the 'cost - what you actually get' trade-off. Second option I checked was using my NAS with its built-in web server. Simply put, I just didn't trust this option (it's my personal data on that NAS). I experimented with a few CMS and had my doubts about many of them: WordPress still seems to have new vulnerabilities each day, Joomla should be easy and simple but made me cry every time I wanted to do something simple, etc.</p><p>In the end I discovered a rather unknown, small and lightweight CMS that seemed exactly what I needed. Just a few options, flexibility in the important parts, and full control over what matters most. I spun up an Amazon instance with a fixed IP address, installed the CMS and manually copied all existing content (thanks Blogger, this is what I'm talking about in terms of flexibility…) and fired up Let's Encrypt. And I'm pretty happy with the result: I changed quite a lot in the source code for customization, played around a bit with all possible settings and ended up with a simple to use yet powerful blogging platform. There's still a few last items I want to address in the near future, but I felt waiting for that could take a lot of time.</p><p>One thing remained a concern though. I actually looked through all of the code to see if anything funny was in there (small CMS, you never know) and verified robustness against parts of the OWASP testing guide, but I'm still not convinced my blog is bullet proof. Even though I could spend hours and days increasing that level of trust, I decided it's not worth it. Worst case scenario: someone replaces all content with something offensive. It's unlikely (2-factor authentication on DNS and Amazon and a CMS that takes security seriously) but always remains possible. If this happens, I can simple pull my blog offline without caring too much until it goes back up: there's little to no impact for me in that case. I've come up with an approach to handle this however; I introduced the concept of <a href="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/responsible-disclosure">responsible disclosure</a> to my blog. If I missed something, I'd appreciate a heads-up and would be happy to have a beer with you. If there's only the abuse, there's some work in it for me but that's it.</p>
