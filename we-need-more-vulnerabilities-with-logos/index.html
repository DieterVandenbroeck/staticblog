			<section class="post-content">
				<p>About 2 years ago, for the first time a vulnerability was introduced with a catchy logo and accompanying website. This created a lot of fuzz and talk and worst of all, it became unclear to most people what exactly the bug and its potential impact was. The Infosec community didn’t like what was happening and made fun of subsequent vulnerabilities that could result in hilarious logos (remember all zombie poodles that flooded Twitter as ‘submissions’?). Yet in the end, everything went quiet again. At least until late March 2016. A catchy name, a website, and the introduction of a new type of disclosure called ‘douche disclosure’ (all credit to Jacob Williams). So what exactly happened here?</p><p>The announcement of Badlock occurred in such a way that it seemed the creators of the logo and website only wanted to get attention. You know what’s worse than attention seekers? That’s right, dealing with the incredible amount of questions of concerned people without having any ‘real’ information. The guys of Naked Security summarized it nicely:</p><blockquote>So here goes, for now, no matter what the Twitter conspiracy vortex says, these are the facts: On 12 April 2016 a crucial security bug in Windows and Samba will be disclosed.</blockquote><p>So what is ‘douche’ disclosure’ and what is the problem with logos and websites to announce vulnerabilities? Try discovering a vulnerability, contacting the vendor agreeing on a timeline but pulling a douche move by talking in the media about the vulnerably long before the patch data, creating a fuzz with a logo and name that even point to the vulnerable code and ensuring that accurate information is missing. This type of disclosure reduces all efforts of proper vulnerability disclosure and communication, and takes a stab at all responsible disclosure programs.</p><p>On its own, naming a vulnerability is not a bad thing. Changes are slim that you actually remember CVE-2014-0160; probably you do remember Heartbleed. Think about all vulnerabilities in SSL, only a handful of people remember the CVE numbers, but most people with a need to know can give more information on CRIME, BEAST, BREACH, FREAK and POODLE (to name a few). A vulnerability such as Heartbleed deserved some attention, and that’s exactly what it got: Twitter was dominated by talks on Heartbleed, XKCD devoted a comic to explain the vulnerability, proper support for critical open-source software such as OpenSSL / LibreSSL was found, national television and radio covered its announcement and the entire C-suite was aware that something was happening. And the latter is exactly what is needed more often.</p><p>When vulnerabilities are only the responsibility of IT, it’s often hard to allocate the required time and resources to properly assess, prioritize and remediate all vulnerabilities. Try convincing the CFO that additional money is required, or try convincing the CRO that patching some servers requires absolute priority. You’re likely to fail and lose this battle until a real change of mentality takes place. The media can help with this, and logos and websites create sometimes much needed fuzz! So instead of fighting this, embrace the positive side effects and –most of all- hope that it was worth it. Because if the patch for Badlock that will be released tomorrow (Tuesday 12 April 2016) shows that the fuzz was not needed, it will be hard to convince the right people the next time…</p><p>[1] <a href="https://malwarejake.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/badlock-what-you-need-to-know-today.html">https://malwarejake.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/badlock-what-you-need-to-know-today.html</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/03/24/badlock-critical-vulnerability-nice-logo-no-details/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/03/24/badlock-critical-vulnerability-nice-logo-no-details/</a> </p><p>[3] <a href="https://xkcd.com/1354/">https://xkcd.com/1354/</a> </p><p>[4] <a href="http://opensslrampage.org/faq">http://opensslrampage.org/faq</a></p>
