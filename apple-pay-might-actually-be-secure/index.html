			<section class="post-content">
				<p>Apple is known to bring very user-friendly products to its wide fan base. The first iPhone was innovative, the MacBook and Mac OS are designed to ‘just work’ (without lots of work and frustrations related to drivers and blue screens), and iPad has become a synonym for ‘tablet’ to many people. Something that has never been associated with Apple was security: they don’t have a bug bounty program, the WPA2-Enterprise implementation in iOS and Mac OS X does not check the wireless network as expected, and their SSL implementation needed an urgent patch a couple of months ago (unrelated to the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL).</p><p>With Apple Pay, introduced together with the new iPhone and the Apple Watch, it seems security was at least as important as usability during the design. Considering the likelihood of your credit card number being stolen these days (just to name a few, there was the Home Depot breach, the P.F. Chang’s Chinese Bistro breach and the Target breach), it’s nice to see a good solution made available to a wider public (people that can and will buy an iPhone 6 / 6 Plus). The magical solution that should win us over is simple yet effective: tokenization combined with NFC and a secure element (protected memory on smart cards that’s reserved for high-security operations).</p><p>When a user wants to associate a new credit card to Apple Pay, the actual credit card number is never stored. The iPhone will make a connection to the payment network or the issuing bank to request a Device Account Number (DAN), which is saved in the secure element. The beauty of the DAN is that it can be used in most systems that check for a ‘valid’ credit card number without having to make any changes to the system (the DAN can be designed to pass the Luhn test). Using this approach, all legacy implementations on all sides of a credit card payment can be used without modification, yet the credit card itself is never used or revealed outside of the payment network and the issuing banks. Not even Apple has a clue what your real card number is (assuming they remove every trace of it after the DAN has been issued).</p><p>When you want to make a payment using Apple Pay, you hold the iPhone with the registered DAN near the NFC reader, and approve the payment using the fingerprint reader. The same principle applies for online payments (without the NFC reader obviously): an approved app from the App Store can use the Apple Pay API to request the DAN from iOS (which is approved by yourself using the fingerprint reader).</p><p>However, at this point the DAN is just a replacement of the credit card number (and still as valuable). For every transaction, an additional ‘dynamic security code’ is required. Compare this to the widespread two-factor authentication mechanism used for VPNs: your password (fixed) and token (time-limited, e.g. RSA SecureID token) are both required to authenticate; the password on its own is useless. With Apple Pay, the DAN is fixed per device, and is useless without the ‘dynamic secure code’ which is time-limited and based on the device. The back-end, in this case the payment network and issuing banks, perform a verification to see if both are valid and linked together to validate the DAN and its usage. All sensitive information and verification is pushed back to 1 location.</p><p>An additional –and very welcome- benefit of this system is that vendors that use Apple Pay instead of full credit card numbers fall out of scope for PCI. Considering the many requirements described in the PCI standard and the potential impact of a breach, merchants will be truly happy with this new system.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-needs-a-bug-bounty-program-1630539492">https://gizmodo.com/apple-needs-a-bug-bounty-program-1630539492</a> </p><p>[2] <a href="https://datanews.knack.be/ict/nieuws/belgische-student-ontdekt-beveiligingsprobleem-bij-apple/article-normal-298715.html">https://datanews.knack.be/ict/nieuws/belgische-student-ontdekt-beveiligingsprobleem-bij-apple/article-normal-298715.html</a> </p><p>[3] <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/</a> </p><p>[4] <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/banks-credit-card-breach-at-home-depot/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/09/banks-credit-card-breach-at-home-depot/</a> </p><p>[5] <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/p-f-changs-confirms-credit-card-breach/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/06/p-f-changs-confirms-credit-card-breach/</a> </p><p>[6] <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/sources-target-investigating-data-breach/">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/sources-target-investigating-data-breach/</a> </p><p>[7] <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/avivah-litan/2014/09/09/will-apple-pay-save-merchants-from-data-breaches/">https://blogs.gartner.com/avivah-litan/2014/09/09/will-apple-pay-save-merchants-from-data-breaches/</a> </p><p>[8] <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2607181/why-apple-pay-could-be-the-mobile-payment-system-youll-actually-use.html ">https://www.macworld.com/article/2607181/why-apple-pay-could-be-the-mobile-payment-system-youll-actually-use.html </a></p><p>[9] <a href="https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/new-iphone-could-herald-change-payments-security-landscape">https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/new-iphone-could-herald-change-payments-security-landscape</a> </p><p>[10] <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3.pdf">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3.pdf</a></p>
