				<p>Often it’s rather hard explaining why the security department needs (additional) funding; if management is not convinced about the real need for proper security, it can be hard for them to see the return on their investment (especially compared to other projects where a specific number can be provided). If you’re a smooth talker, or you know how to convince management of whatever idea you have, this might be less of a problem. But for most people, this is a real problem. What is the risk the company is exposed to without a proper vulnerability management program; can you put a specific number on that risk? Can you explain how much the risk decreases when you assign the right people to the job?</p><p>Luckily management is getting more aware on this subject, so that the initial conversation isn’t that hard. But, you’ll still be required to show that their investment is paying off: this is where metrics and dashboards come to play. A couple of graphs with nice colors is everything management needs to make a decision. And with vulnerability management, there are a couple of clear metrics to be used: number of assets that are scanned, number of vulnerabilities identified, and number of (high risk) vulnerabilities that are open. So, getting more advanced and getting more people in the team means that the first number needs to go up and the third number needs to go down. Often, that’s how the investment is justified.</p><p>Does it make sense? Consider the company’s crown jewels: the customer database, the R&amp;D plans, that server that controls all of your robot’s activities, etc. Do you take the sensitivity of this asset into account? If you report on vulnerabilities without taking the value of the asset containing the vulnerability into account, you’re comparing apples with oranges. That remote privileged code execution vulnerability will probably be at the top of the remediation activities list, but does prioritizing something like this make sense? Consider two different assets containing this vulnerability, and ask yourself the question “When detected, would the remediation efforts be prioritized differently for both assets, and would the reporting be different?”.</p><p>What if the host containing the mentioned vulnerability is part of an isolated segment only used by a handful of people containing no sensitive data without any domain accounts? Would you prioritize remediation? The real impact might be a value much lower than your classification of “Low”. But probably, you use the CVSS score provided by the software / scanning vendor, which would be 10, making the vulnerability critical.</p><p>What if the server containing all core data and applications would be vulnerable, would you prioritize remediation? Of course, because exploitation could mean the end of the company.</p><p>What if your web application server located in the DMZ, containing only static, non-sensitive information, was vulnerable? Suppose your layered defenses can decrypt all traffic, identify attacks and block all malicious traffic before reaching the server – what kind of prioritization would you assign?</p><p>The real question is: would you see the difference between all three vulnerabilities, and would you be able to prioritize appropriately? If your answer is yes, would this be done for all vulnerabilities identified, regardless of the source, or would it only be done when the vulnerability was identified as part of an assessment against a very specific scope?</p><p>How you tackle this problem highly depends on what kind of resources are available. If you’ve got a CMDB available that contains up-to-date, specific information, you might be able to prioritize your efforts based on an approach that actually makes sense. However, you’ll still require the right people and the right organization culture: without the time and the ability to explain the risk to the appropriate people, your efforts could be in vain.</p><p>The main message is not to get too comfortable with your numbers. Management might be happy because the graphs are green and the numbers are looking good, but if your metrics are useless, the values associated don’t matter.</p><p>(Thanks to MH for giving me the idea for this post - <a href="https://blog.thinkst.com/2015/11/enterprise-security-wood-for-trees.html">https://blog.thinkst.com/2015/11/enterprise-security-wood-for-trees.html</a>)</p>
