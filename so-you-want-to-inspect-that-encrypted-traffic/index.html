				<p>11-03-2013 01:00</p><p><em>An easy-to-understand description on SSL inspection</em></p><p>Most people already know you can connect to websites in ‘a secure way’. The terms HTTPS and SSL/TLS might also ring a bell with some people. But what it is exactly, or what it does protect is not always known. Even more important, what can be inspected from your ‘secure’ traffic is unknown to most people. Let’s start with this secure web browsing. When your browser makes a secure connection to a website, it will connect using HTTPS. This can be seen in the URL (<a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>), but most browsers also indicate this with a closed padlock or a green URL prefix. You might even have seen a page that said ‘The validity of the server cannot be verified’. This usually means the domain in the certificate was different than the URL visited (e.g. you visited yyy.google.com instead of www.google.com).</p><p>Your connection over HTTPS is secure in 2 ways: first, it verifies the identity of the server. So if you surf to <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>, your browser will receive the certificate for this domain, and is able to check that it really is Google that it is connected to. To do this, certificates need to be linked to Root Certificate Authorities. Secondly, your communication with the server will be encrypted. This way, an attacker cannot look at your data to retrieve your username and password, or even to take over your identity!</p><p>Not only attackers are interested in your surfing behaviour, companies also want to inspect all your traffic. Of course, the motivation is different: attackers want to gain something (e.g. your credentials or identity), companies want to protect themselves. To make sure you don’t send all that sensitive information to their rivals, they want to check on you (Data Leakage Prevention). Of course, they also want to protect the network against bad guys: Java applets from untrusted sources might exploit a well-known vulnerability (especially with all the disclosed java vulnerabilities these days), that email attachment promising you the treasure of a Nigerian prince just might contain malware, and some browser extensions are really not needed for you to be able to perform your job.</p><p>To monitor the traffic between all employee computers in the network and the servers they connect to, dedicated devices can be placed in the network. Their only goal is to check on all traffic that goes in and out the organization, and check this against a policy. Ideally, this is done on-the-flow, with complete session knowledge, with complete inspection of the packets headers and data (deep packet inspection). However, not only attackers are excluded from looking at your data. A secure connection also excludes your company and its fancy monitoring devices from monitoring your data. And no, this is not something they like.</p><p>Indeed, you’ve guessed correctly, a solution was developed. The thing about HTTPS and the use of certificates to ensure the server’s identity is that it is built on trust. A few Root CAs are added to your browser’s trusted list (preconfigured, done by yourself, etc.), and all certificates they issue to other companies are trusted because you trust their hierarchical parent (or grand-parent, or ...). Root CAs will put effort in making sure they only grant certain companies a certificate (by requesting proof of their existence and provided data, by checking their website’s purpose, etc.). If you have control over your laptop/desktop/device, you can add and remove trust relationships. If your company controls this list, you have to trust the company. So if your company takes up the role of Root CA, well...</p><p>Let’s take a look at that first example again. You use your company laptop to connect to <a href="https://www.google.com/">https://www.google.com</a>. You see the closed padlock and the https when the website is presented, and you feel confident about the connection’s security. You even feel so confident you search for something that is against company policy (feel free to pick an example). But have you checked this chain of trust? Your browser might not give any warnings because it thinks everything is ok: the certificate presented is issued to www.google.com, and the Root CA is in the trusted list. But, have you checked which Root CA issued the certificate? You’ve guessed correctly, it was your own company.</p><p>By playing Root CA themselves, secure connections can be made between your browser and the inspector box (let’s call it the Inspector), and the Inspector and the server. No one will complain, an attacker won’t be able to monitor your traffic, and your company can still monitor your traffic. This is not a new technique, but not a lot of people know this is possible. So next time you think everything is ok and no one can monitor your traffic: you are warned...</p>
