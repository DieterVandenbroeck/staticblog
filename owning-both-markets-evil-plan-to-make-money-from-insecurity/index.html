				<p>Rumor goes that certain clothing companies are selling both their ‘traditional’ products and their cheaper, fake counterparts. I don’t know the full extent of these stories and what’s behind them, but it does make sense: if someone is going to make easy money using your brand’s name, why shouldn’t the company behind the brand get what it works for? It makes sense, and it’s hard to make valid arguments against such practices.</p><p>Some might call this evil or unethical, but from an economical perspective it adds up. Imagine we’re back in 2007, you just made a huge investment to come up with the first real smartphone, and it’s a hit. Regardless of the type of product or service, or the kind of protection mechanisms like patents you have, other people will take your idea and make money off it, using only a fraction of the budget you required for the original idea. And when you play it really smart, no one will ever suspect you’re behind the ‘rip-off’ or ‘fake’ as well. Following this approach, you might be able to get 200% of the profit using only 110% of the investment. I’m not an expert in economics, but I do like those numbers.</p><p>How does this relate to security? Today, information and data are money. With companies that are offering services for free you know the deal: you provide information about yourself that is sold to third parties (mostly for advertising), and in return you get a free product. This is the new norm, and people have accepted this: giving up some information (and privacy) in return for something they want.</p><p>What about companies where you actually pay for the service; can you justify paying both prices (monetary and your information) for something you want? And what about the information you provided, what happens to it? Is it only shared with a limited number of third parties, managed through strictly managed contracts? Or, arriving at the worst-case scenario: is it worth paying for a service knowing that the company is rather insecure, and knowing that there’s a pretty high likelihood that your data might be for sale in the near future?</p><p>A lot of companies get breached, and often customer’s data (personal data, medical data or credit card data) ends up for sale on the black market. These companies suffer a blow, but there name is out and people will forget (or stop caring) soon, remembering the company’s name but not the reason.</p><p>If a company would make sure it’s customer data is sold at a nice price, it could make a lot of money. Of course there will be some negative publicity, but if this is properly controlled the damage could be minimal. For most companies the question is not if they will be breached, but when they will be hit. Taking the above logic into account, it would be only ‘fair’ for such companies to make sure they’re the ones selling the data, not the attackers.</p><p>Obviously I’m not encouraging companies to leak their own customer data to cash in, but I do like the train of thought – it makes sense in some absurd way.</p>
