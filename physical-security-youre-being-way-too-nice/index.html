				<p>Physical security has been important since the day physical things became of value to other living beings. From securing the first farms against animals trampling all crops, to keeping spies out of your super-secret underground facility where those super-super-secret weapons that are used in movies are developed. From a theoretical point of view, it’s really not that hard. But, yet again, humans often prove to be the weakest link.</p><p>Personally, I've always liked exploring those hallways I didn't know. And why would I show my id if I can get in anyway? On the other hand, during my professional career (and especially at clients), I've never put physical protection measures to the test just for the sake of it. But sometimes, when you forget your badge or take the stairs, it becomes obvious that all of that ‘bringing your badge’ and ‘going through the gates one by one’ isn't always necessary.</p><p>To list a few recent examples, I've received a badge at a client I've never visited before just by showing my phone (there wasn't even something visibly referencing to that client), doors were opened just by smiling at cleaning personnel and (supposed) colleagues, and –I especially like this one- a door hiding the staircase at a certain floor was located in front of the security gates, while the other floors had the staircase inside the ‘protected’ zone. All of examples have one common aspect: humans being too nice (or just too stupid to look beyond what was in front of them).</p><p>Let’s be honest, it’s clear to state that no one should receive a visitor badge / should be given access without proper identification and prior announcement. But who wants to be the guy blamed every day because meetings start late, just because you were following the rules? And are you going to close the door in someone’s face because you can’t see a badge? In a few cases, it’s just about not looking beyond what you see in front of you.</p><p>In all of these cases, there was no social engineering involved. Forget about training all personnel; sometimes, enhancing your security just means being a little less friendly to strangers. If done properly, those strangers will understand why you’re doing this. Think about full-body scanners at airports; you may feel violated and think it’s ‘rude’, but at least it’s clear why this method is used. In other cases, it’s just about common sense and taking a minute to think about what you just did.</p>
