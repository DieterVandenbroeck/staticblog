				<p>When a fire destroys your company’s building, top-level management will assemble to manage the crisis. Through proper preparation and hard lessons, most crisis management teams know how to respond to most situations. On the one hand because too many organizations went down after being unable to cope with crises, on the other hand because it’s just a matter of answering very basis ‘what if’ questions. Sadly enough, the people responsible for managing such a crisis are very confident, all-knowing, and perhaps not entirely up to speed with all developments related to cyber security. Which makes them unable to properly respond to a crisis related to cyber security. Which makes them likely to fail in their intention. Doesn’t sound right, does it?</p><p>During the 2016 RSA Conference it became very clear that CISOs need to be better connected to the business1. Because InfoSec is still seen as an IT problem instead of a business problem, the board does not care about the CISOs specific challenges because it’s too technical. When the CISO is ignored by the board, so are multiple of the top 10 risks every organization faces. The dark ages ended a while ago and everything becomes connected; because too few people actually care about proper security, every organization should embrace the fact that a successful cyber-attack will happen. If the board cannot understand this fact, or cannot see that the CISO is becoming increasingly important to every organization, they are facing doom.</p><p>Suppose the crisis management team is assembled on a Friday afternoon because an important business application is going down because of a Denial of Service attack. Where the board may scream out due to reputational damage and lost revenue, there’s (almost) nothing they can do. A properly organized networking team / CSIRT will have done everything they can (which isn’t a lot) and can only report on the volume of the attack. A CISO however will realize this attack could be part of something more. Often the aftermath of a DoS attack revealed the true activities of the attackers, making it clear the visible attack was only intended to shift focus away from their real goal (e.g. siphoning money to their own accounts). This is something you don’t expect the board to know, but you expect the CISO to know. Wouldn’t you expect the CISO to be in the boardroom then?</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/blogs/14/post/86973-connecting-for-cybersecurity-why-cisos-need-to-get-out-of-server-rooms-and-into-board-rooms">https://www.securitymagazine.com/blogs/14/post/86973-connecting-for-cybersecurity-why-cisos-need-to-get-out-of-server-rooms-and-into-board-rooms</a></p>
