				<p>There have been many debates on the usefulness of HTTPS for every website (including static websites), with <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/">Troy Hunt</a> and Â <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/we-dont-do-https-for-backwards-compatibility/">Scott Helme</a> as strong (and loud) supporters. So far it seems that most websites that are maintained by organizations and individuals that see the need for HTTPS have implemented this. A large portion of websites only added HTTPS support <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads">in the last 2 years</a>, leaving it up to the big companies before that point. Why is that?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/01/image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>A huge increase in web pages loaded over HTTPS can be seen between 2017 - 2019.</figcaption></figure><p>HTTPS was finalized as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">RFC 2818</a> in May 2000 (almost 19 years ago). Prior to the publication, Netscape already worked on the basis and offered this increased security even in July 1995, targeting <a href="https://www.jefftk.com/p/history-of-https-usage">secure credit card transmissions</a>. Around 2005 HTTPS was described as the way to go for online banking websites, stock trading and retailing. Around 2010 â 2011, HTTPS was finally adopted by major technology players like Google, Twitter and Facebook for general use (i.e. not limited to financial information or the authenticated sections). One of the main drivers here was the increased use of public Wi-Fi and general awareness on the matter. </p><p>From that point on, more and more websites were being served securely. The launch of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">Letâs Encrypt</a> definitely played a big role here; where certificates issued by other Certificate Authorities easily ranged between <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/cheap-ssl-certificates-and-recommendations-3469539">$50 â $200</a>, Letâs Encrypt started offering free certificates that are automatically renewed. Once they were included in the major certificate trust stores across platforms, both hurdles of price and maintenance disappeared at once. And yet, many websites have not made the transition yet. Why? Probably because HTTP is still the default option and not all website administrators have sufficient knowledge and awareness on the matter. How could this be changed?</p><p>Administrators of Top Level Domains (TLD) can play an important role here. When I wrote about the <a href="../are-bank-domains-pure-marketing-or-is-there-something-to-it/index.html">.bank TLD</a>, one of the highlights I discovered was the increased security requirements for all domains, including mandatory HTTPS. This requirement is very easy to enforce using the <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list</a>; adding the entire .bank domain to this list ensures that most major browsers only connect to any website on this domain over HTTPS. In this HSTS preload file (<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json">maintained as a json</a>), we find the full list of TLDs that enforce HTTPS on all domains through HSTS (lines 266 â 279; lines shortened for clarity):</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>// gTLDs and eTLDs are welcome to preload if they are interested.</code><br>
<code>{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;android&quot;, &quot;policy&quot;: &quot;public-suffix&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;force-https&quot;, &quot;include_subdomains&quot;: true },</code><br>

<code>{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;youtube&quot;, &quot;policy&quot;: &quot;public-suffix&quot;, &quot;mode&quot;: &quot;force-https&quot;, ... },</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Using <a href="https://icannwiki.org">icannwiki</a> we can see that 11 out of 13 TLDs on this list are maintained by Google, and the other 2 are maintained by the fTLD Registry (responsible for .bank and .insurance). When the TLD market was opened and new propositions were accepted years ago, a huge increase in the amount of TLDs was expected. Of the 1534 TLDs that are available (the full list is available <a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">here</a>), only 13 or 0.85% enforce secure connections over HTTPS. And only 2 companies, Google being one of them, are behind this. </p><p>Going through the list of ânewâ TLDs a few interesting options pop up, such as <a href="https://icannwiki.org/.secure">.secure</a> and <a href="https://icannwiki.org/.trust">.trust</a>. Surely these TLDs were designed to create a safe web? It seems the idea behind both were exactly that, with premium prices for a domain backed by some security requirements. In reality it seems the hoped-for success was never realized; nTLDStats notes 14 registered non-parked .trust domains (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A.trust+-digicert.trust+-whodoyou.trust+-nccgroup.trust+-nic.trust+-escrowlive.trust">Google gives 5 results</a>) and only 1 parked .secure domain. Interestingly enough, one of the non-parked .trust domains belongs to Digicert, but they don't seem to put a lot of value in it:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.dietervandenbroeck.be/content/images/2019/01/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Digicert apparently parked its digicert.trust domain as well...</figcaption></figure><p>While it may be difficult to put an already existing TLD on the HSTS preload list (probably breaking large parts of the internet), the inclusion of new TLDs would only result in a benefit. While opinions on Google and its every-expanding reach may differ, they have just done that. The <a href="https://icannwiki.org/.page">.page TLD</a> is generally available since 9 October 2018, has its place on the HSTS preload list (line 277) and already has 8071 registrations (on 15 January 2019). The first sentence in their <a href="https://get.page/#success-stories">âWhy .page?â marketing text</a> even talks about a more secure online presence. More initiatives such as this one may ultimately result in a safer internet for all.</p>
